Originally, the root cause was thought to be confined to Bluetooth/wireless communications between the control pendant and the surgical table. However, during investigation, Mizuho discovered that the failure could be replicated even in wired mode if communication between the pendant and table were somehow interrupted. The root cause appears to be: if communication between the controller and table is interrupted while a button is pressed, the table does not know if/when a button is released.
